####Design
* Colour Scheme
    * The two main colours used are Red and Yellow. Red and yellow are synonomous with the Harry Potter series so they are good choices for the purpose of this website. 
* Typography
    * The Abel font is the main font used throughout the website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case the font isn't being imported to the site correctly. It is clean, simple and easy to read and is similar to the original font associated with Harry Pooter.
